# Women's Preventive AI (Kenya) – MVP

Combined Preventive Health + Mental Health app.

## Scope
- Assessments: breast/cervical/osteoporosis risks, stress check-ins.
- Alerts & reminders (no emergency features in MVP).
- Privacy-first: explicit consent for sensitive data, minimal PII, encryption in transit.
- Languages: English. Region: Kenya.

## Tech Stack
- Mobile: Flutter (client) – to be added next.
- Backend: Node.js (Express) + Postgres.
- AI: On-device lightweight classifiers. Optional cloud inference later with strict guardrails.

## Repos
- Backend: `backend/`
- Flutter App: `app/` (TBD)

## Getting Started (Backend)
See `backend/README.md`.

## Next Steps
- Initialize Flutter app with onboarding, assessment flow, privacy center.
- Add Kenya-specific resources directory (MOH, NHIF, mental health hotlines, facilities).
- Add push notification service integration.
